# Toy App

> Built with Ruby on Rails with more emphasis on Rails MVC design


Additional description about the project and its features.

I created three models namely **User**, **Micropost** and used my knowledge of Active Record to set up Validations and Associations on each of the models.

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails --v 6.1.3
- Ruby --v 2.7.3
- SQL

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

Clone the repository by running ```git clone https://github.com/karvel-code/toy_app``` in the directory you wish to clone into.

Or download the Zip folder at ```https://github.com/karvel-code/toy_app/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip```

run  ```yarn ```

run ```bundle```

run ```rails c ``` to open rails  console and be able to interact with the models.

You can also ```require hirb``` in the console and run ```Hirb.enable``` to have a nice display of the data.
